# Internet Kids Website Architecture

## Overview
The Internet Kids website is built using Flutter Web, providing a modern, responsive, and interactive user interface. The site features dynamic animations, rave mode effects, and seamless navigation between pages.

## Core Components

### 1. Main App (`InternetKidsWebsite`)
- Root widget of the application
- Handles theme configuration
- Sets up routing system
- Defines global styles

### 2. Pages
- `HomePage`: Main landing page with project showcase
- `DistortionPage`: Product page for the distortion plugin

### 3. Custom Widgets
- `RaveGridPainter`: Custom painter for background effects
- `TrailPoint`: Data structure for particle effects
- Project cards and social buttons

## State Management

### HomePage State
- `_raveMode`: Controls rave mode animations
- `_intensity`: Controls animation intensity
- `_currentRaveIndex`: Manages cycling text/colors
- `_raveTimer`: Controls animation timing

### DistortionPage State
- `_ghostMode`: Controls ghost mode effects
- `_intensity`: Controls ghost effect intensity
- `_ghostTimer`: Manages ghost animations
- `_ghostParticles`: Manages particle positions

## Animation System

### Background Animations
1. Default Mode
   - Matrix-style falling characters
   - Customizable speeds and lengths
   - Character set includes Latin and Japanese

2. Rave Mode
   - Animated grid lines
   - Color cycling effects
   - Intensity-based scaling
   - Dynamic shadows and glows

3. Ghost Mode
   - Wavy grid patterns
   - Floating particles
   - Red color scheme
   - Ethereal effects

### Text Animations
- Smooth transitions between states
- Scale transformations
- Color interpolation
- Shadow effects

## Styling System

### Color Schemes
1. Default Mode
   - Primary: Cyan
   - Background: Dark purple
   - Accents: Magenta, Yellow

2. Rave Mode
   - Cycling colors array
   - Dynamic intensity
   - Glow effects

3. Ghost Mode
   - Primary: Red
   - Dynamic opacity
   - Ethereal effects

### Typography

- Dynamic text effects
- Shadow and glow variations

## Navigation

### Route Structure
```
/                   -> HomePage
/distortion         -> DistortionPage
```

### Navigation Features
- Smooth transitions
